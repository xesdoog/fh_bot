###  

## Strict Requirements:
- You must have Oblitum's [Interception Driver](https://github.com/oblitum/Interception) installed. Otherwise, the bot will not work.

###  

## Optional Requirements:
- If you want to just run the `.ahk` file as is, you must have [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed and the script must always be in the same folder as the lib folder.
- Or you can just simply run the compiled executable found in the [releases section](https://github.com/xesdoog/fh_bot/releases).
